------------------------------------------------------------- QUESTION -----------------------------------------------------------

Table: Weather

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| id            | int     |
| recordDate    | date    |
| temperature   | int     |
+---------------+---------+
id is the column with unique values for this table. There are no different rows with the same recordDate. This table contains information about the temperature on a certain day.

Write a solution to find all dates' Id with higher temperatures compared to its previous dates (yesterday). Return the result table in any order.

Example 1:

Input: 
Weather table:
+----+------------+-------------+
| id | recordDate | temperature |
+----+------------+-------------+
| 1  | 2015-01-01 | 10          |
| 2  | 2015-01-02 | 25          |
| 3  | 2015-01-03 | 20          |
| 4  | 2015-01-04 | 30          |
+----+------------+-------------+

Output: 
+----+
| id |
+----+
| 2  |
| 4  |
+----+

Explanation: 
In 2015-01-02, the temperature was higher than the previous day (10 -> 25).
In 2015-01-04, the temperature was higher than the previous day (20 -> 30).

SELECT W1.id as Id
FROM Weather W1, Weather W2 
WHERE
    DATEDIFF(W1.recordDate, W2.recordDate) = 1
    AND
    W1.temperature > W2.temperature;
